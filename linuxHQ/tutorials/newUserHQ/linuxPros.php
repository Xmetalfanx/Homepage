  <p class="boldUnderline">Advantages to linux </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>You are not limited to having to use Microsoft's Operating System and  all of it's flaws, including Spyware/Malware, Registry
    Problems, Viruses and Trojans, ...etc </p>

    <li>
    <p>(Most) linux's are 100% free... at least they are suppose to be (for Home users).... the ones that cost money are for for enterprise/business use anyway
    </p>
    <li>
    <p>Not counting a &ldquo;base system&rdquo;, you install (or have installed by default) what you want
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>(This sort of goes with the last bullet-point) I have noticed that while sometimes there are Gigabytes of data installed with Windows.
         have been testing ( &ldquo;playing with&rdquo;) a number of distribution is and even after install a large number of packages
         (Programs), I see  &ldquo;used space&rdquo; at 3GB TOTAL.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Granted  that every distribution is different
        </p>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>
    <span class="italics">Granted that everyone uses different software]
    </span>
    <ul>
      <li>Many programs are exactly  (different installers, but same program) as in Windows.  If you are  	very familiar with any of these programs, then you will be glad to  	know they are the same in linux and its sense of something familiar  	when you try linux.
      <ul>
        <li>Examples:
        <ul>
          <li>Pidgin </li>
          <li>Firefox </li>
          <li>Chromium (The open source browser, Google customizes and calls it's own) </li>
          <li>VLC  Media Player </li>
          <li>Clementine Media Player </li>
          <li>Open Office </li>
          <li>libre Office </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>All  of the &ldquo;System Recovery&rdquo; Cds/DVDs I have seen ARE linux.  I have to say that I have seen many users not even able to
    get into Safe  	Mode in Windows, and they think everything is lost. I have them boot          linux (any of these recovery discs OR any
    live distribution for that  	matter), and they can get to ALL of their files and backup no  	problem.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In  the case of many new live distribution's
    <span class="italics">(whatever version of linux it  is)
    </span>, you can even play videos and audio files right away... no need to install ANYTHING.  This can be a savior
    for people that need to  get to a certain file or anything of         that nature and Windows is not working correctly.
    </li>
  </ul>
